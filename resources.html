                    A rapid pace of real house price appreciation by itself does not necessarily imply that real
                    house prices are becoming out of step with fundamentals. Still, we recognize that real house
                    price increases today could become out of step with fundamentals supported instead by the
                    expectation of robust future price increases. If enough buyers share the same beliefs about the
                    future prospects in the housing market, their purchases will help drive current house prices up
                    and validate the expectation that strong house price gains will continue. This self-fulfilling
                    prophecy keeps the housing market misaligned from its fundamentals until enough investors
                    become leery of a bust, the flow of money into housing dries out, and eventually the feared
                    collapse occurs.

                </p>
                <p>
                    An expectations-driven real house price appreciation may lead to a misallocation of resources
                    in the economy and distorted investment patterns. Therefore, monitoring for such episodes of
                    exuberance (booms) and collapse (busts) in housing markets may help avoid a repeat of the
                    economic trauma caused by the international boom-bust housing cycle that preceded the 2008
                    Great Recession (Pavlidis et al., 2016). We take a look at International housing markets (Mack
                    and Martínez-García, 2011) with the novel Generalized Sup ADF (GSADF) test of Phillips et al.
                    (2015a,b) to detect empirical evidence of exuberance. The latest findings across all
                    international housing markets are summarized in this website.

                    The Globalization Institute of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces an international house
                    price database, which comprises quarterly house price and personal disposable income (PDI) series
                    for a number of countries. All data series begin in first quarter 1975. A detailed description of
                    the sources and methodology can be found in Mack and Martínez-García (2011), which is updated
                    whenever modifications to the database occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We select a house price index for each country that is most consistent with the quarterly U.S.
                    house price index for existing single-family houses produced by the Federal Housing Finance
                    Agency. We extend the preferred series for each country back to first quarter 1975 either with
                    historical data or with data from secondary sources. Each country’s house price index is seasonally
                    adjusted over the entire sample period with an unobserved components time series model and then
                    rebased
                    to 2005 = 100.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PDI series are quoted in per capita terms using working-age population. Both the house price
                    and PDI series are quoted in nominal and real terms. Real values are computed using the personal
                    consumption expenditure deflator. For each series, we produce a weighted average of all
                    countries in the database, using purchasing power parity-adjusted gross domestic product shares in
                    2005.

             <h2 class="text-center">Monitoring Exuberance and Collapses in Housing Markets </h2>
             <h4 class="text-center">An Application to International Housing Markets</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    Mildly explosive behavior is modeled by an autoregressive process with a root that exceeds unity,
                    but
                    remains within the vicinity of one (Phillips et al., 2015a,b). This represents a small departure
                    from
                    martingale behavior, but is consistent with the submartingale property often used in the asset
                    pricing literature to model self-fulfilling prophecies (rational bubbles). The GSADF test achieves
                    this by recursively implementing a right-tailed ADF-type regression test using a rolling window
                    procedure (Phillips et al., 2015a,b; Pavlidis et al., 2016).

                </p>
                <p>
                    More specifically, the GSADF test considers an ADF regression for a rolling interval beginning with
                    a
                    fraction r1 and ending with a fraction r2 of the total number of observations, with the size of the
                    window being rw = r2 − r1. The parameters in the ADF regression are estimated by ordinary least
                    squares (OLS) and then an ADF statistic is calculated to test the null of a unit-root against the
                    right-sided alternative of mildly explosive behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phillips et al. (2015a,b) formulated a procedure whereby the ADF statistic is repeatedly calculated
                    for a fixed share r2 of the whole sample and the window size is expanded from an initial fraction r0
                    to r2. The supremum of this sequence of statistics for each r1 ∈ [0, r2 - r0] is the sup ADF (SADF)
                    statistic. The generalized sup ADF (GSADF) statistic is then constructed from the corresponding
                    sequence of SADF statistics for each r2 ∈ [r0, 1].
                </p>
                <p>
                    The GSADF approach uses a variable window width approach, allowing starting as well as ending points
                    to change within a predefined range [r0, 1], which enhances the flexibility of the ADF framework to
                    identify consistently, periodically-occurring periods of mildly explosive behavior within a sample.
                    The resulting GSADF statistic can then be used to test the null hypotheses of unit root against its
                    right-tailed mildly explosive alternative by comparing it to its corresponding critical values.
                    Further technical details on the implementation of the GSADF procedure to housing data, specifically
                    for international housing markets, can be found in Pavlidis et al. (2016).

                <p>
                    Statistical significance based on the GSADF procedure can be assessed against critical values
                    obtained under the null hypothesis of no-explosive behavior. The Backward SADF (BSADF)
                    statistic computed over the sequence of ADF for all possible r1 and r2 (Phillips et al.
                    (2015a,b)): when above the 95% critical value – indicates evidence of mildly explosive behavior
                    at conventional statistical levels. GSADF statistic below 95% critical value, but above 90% (or
                    for some just 80%) critical value – indicates that caution seems warranted, but there is not
                    enough evidence to detect mildly explosive behavior at conventional statistical significance
                    levels. GSADF statistic below 90% (or 80%) critical value – indicates that there is not enough
                    evidence to signal an episode of mildly explosive behavior.
