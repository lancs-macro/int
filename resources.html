                A rapid pace of real house price appreciation by itself does not necessarily imply that real
                house prices are becoming out of step with fundamentals. Still, we recognize that real house
                price increases today could become out of step with fundamentals supported instead by the
                expectation of robust future price increases. If enough buyers share the same beliefs about the
                future prospects in the housing market, their purchases will help drive current house prices up
                and validate the expectation that strong house price gains will continue. This self-fulfilling
                prophecy keeps the housing market misaligned from its fundamentals until enough investors
                become leery of a bust, the flow of money into housing dries out, and eventually the feared
                collapse occurs.

            </p>
            <p>
                An expectations-driven real house price appreciation may lead to a misallocation of resources
                in the economy and distorted investment patterns. Therefore, monitoring for such episodes of
                exuberance (booms) and collapse (busts) in housing markets may help avoid a repeat of the
                economic trauma caused by the international boom-bust housing cycle that preceded the 2008
                Great Recession (Pavlidis et al., 2016). We take a look at International housing markets (Mack
                and Martínez-García, 2011) with the novel Generalized Sup ADF (GSADF) test of Phillips et al.
                (2015a,b) to detect empirical evidence of exuberance. The latest findings across all
                international housing markets are summarized in this website.

                <p>
                    The Globalization Institute of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces an international house
                    price database, which comprises quarterly house price and personal disposable income (PDI) series
                    for a number of countries. All data series begin in first quarter 1975. A detailed description of
                    the sources and methodology can be found in Mack and Martínez-García (2011), which is updated
                    whenever modifications to the database occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We select a house price index for each country that is most consistent with the quarterly U.S.
                    house price index for existing single-family houses produced by the Federal Housing Finance
                    Agency. We extend the preferred series for each country back to first quarter 1975 either with
                    historical data or with data from secondary sources. Each country’s house price index is seasonally
                    adjusted over the entire sample period with an unobserved components time series model and then
                    rebased
                    to 2005 = 100.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PDI series are quoted in per capita terms using working-age population. Both the house price
                    and PDI series are quoted in nominal and real terms. Real values are computed using the personal
                    consumption expenditure deflator. For each series, we produce a weighted average of all
                    countries in the database, using purchasing power parity-adjusted gross domestic product shares in
                    2005.

        <h2 class="text-center">Monitoring Exuberance and Collapses in Housing Markets </h2>
        <h4 class="text-center">An Application to International Housing Markets</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    Mildly explosive behavior is modeled by an autoregressive process with a root that exceeds unity,
                    but remains within the vicinity of one (Phillips et al., 2015a,b). This represents a small departure
                    from martingale behavior, but is consistent with the submartingale property often used in the asset
                    pricing literature to model self-fulfilling prophecies (rational bubbles). The GSADF test achieves
                    this by recursively implementing a right-tailed ADF-type regression test using a rolling window
                    procedure (Phillips et al., 2015a,b; Pavlidis et al., 2016).

                </p>
                <p>
                    More specifically, the GSADF test considers an ADF regression for a rolling interval beginning with
                    a
                    fraction r1 and ending with a fraction r2 of the total number of observations, with the size of the
                    window being rw = r2 − r1. The parameters in the ADF regression are estimated by ordinary least
                    squares (OLS) and then an ADF statistic is calculated to test the null of a unit-root against the
                    right-sided alternative of mildly explosive behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Phillips et al. (2015a,b) formulated a procedure whereby the ADF statistic is repeatedly calculated
                    for a fixed share r2 of the whole sample and the window size is expanded from an initial fraction r0
                    to r2. The supremum of this sequence of statistics for each r1 ∈ [0, r2 - r0] is the sup ADF (SADF)
                    statistic. The generalized sup ADF (GSADF) statistic is then constructed from the corresponding
                    sequence of SADF statistics for each r2 ∈ [r0, 1].
                </p>
                <p>
                    The GSADF approach uses a variable window width approach, allowing starting as well as ending points
                    to change within a predefined range [0, r<sub>2</sub>-r<sub>0</sub>], which enhances the flexibility
                    of the ADF framework to
                    identify consistently, periodically-occurring periods of mildly explosive behavior within a sample.
                    The resulting GSADF statistic can then be used to test the null hypotheses of unit root against its
                    right-tailed mildly explosive alternative by comparing it to its corresponding critical values.
                    Further technical details on the implementation of the GSADF procedure to housing data, specifically
                    for international housing markets, can be found in Pavlidis et al. (2016).
                </p>

            <h4 style="padding-top:2rem;" class="text-center">Reporting the Evidence</h2>
                <div class="container">

                    <p>
                        Statistical significance based on the GSADF procedure can be assessed against critical values
                        obtained under the null hypothesis
                        of no-explosive behavior over the entire testing period. The alternative is that there is at
                        least one speculative period over the sample.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the identification of exuberance periods, the backward SADF (BSADF) statistic is computed
                        for each r2, which ranges between r0 and 1.
                        The BSADF test for r2 is the supremum of the ADF statistic sequence obtained from subsamples
                        whose ending points are on r2 and starting points vary between 0 and r2-r0. The BSADF statistics
                        are linked to the GSADF statistic in the form of GSADF=sup(BSADF_r2), where the sup is taken
                        over all values of r2. The BSADF statistic sequence is compared with its corresponding critical
                        value sequence for the identification of starting and ending dates of exuberance. See Phillips,
                        et al. (2015ab) for details.</p>
                    <p>
                        The GSADF test is conducted in the first step. If we reject the null hypothesis of no
                        exuberance, the BSADF test is then employed to
                        identify the bubble origination and termination dates. Test statistics below 95% critical value,
                        but above 90% (or for some just 80%) critical
                        value – indicates that caution seems warranted, but there is not enough evidence to detect
                        mildly explosive behavior at conventional statistical significance levels. Test statistic below
                        90% (or 80%) critical value – indicates that there is not enough evidence to signal an episode
                        of mildly explosive behavior.

                            which implements the univariate and panel recursive unit root tests of Phillips et
                            al. (2015)
                            and Pavlidis et al. (2016) respectively, for dating periods of explosive dynamics
                            (exuberance). The package also
                            simulates a variety of periodically-collapsing bubble processes. The estimation code
                            utilizes the matrix inversion
                            lemma in the recursive least squares algorithm which results in significant speed
                            improvements.

                        The PSY-IVX approach has two steps. The first step decomposes log price-to-rent ratios into
                        fundamental
                        and non-fundamental components. The fundamental component reflects underlying economic and
                        financial conditions
                        that are relevant to the housing market and the determination of house prices. The
                        non-fundamental component is a
                        residual that embodies the impact of speculative behavior in the market. The decomposition
                        is
                        accomplished using a
                        recently developed IVX estimation technique and a reduced-form econometric model that
                        measures
                        the empirical effects
                        of economic fundamentals. This approach allows for complex trending features in the data as
                        well
                        as the interdependencies
                        that are characteristic of many indicators of prevailing economic conditions. The second
                        step
                        applies the PSY explosive detection
                        method to the estimated non-fundamental component, thereby revealing the extent of
                        speculative
                        market behaviour that goes beyond
                        prevailing economic indicators.

                        For the decomposition, we separate the sample into a training sample (until December 2019)
                        and a
                        monitoring sample (from January 2020 onward).
                        The reduced-form regression model is estimated with IVX using data from the training sample,
                        accounting for dependence over time in the data.
                        The estimated model coefficients are used to compute the non-fundamental component in both
                        the
                        training and monitoring samples. For the PSY
                        explosive root test, the minimum window size is set as <em>T<sub>min </sub> = 0.01T<sub>0
                            </sub>
                            + 1.8√T<sub>0</sub> </em> , where T<sub>0</sub> is the number of observations in the
                        training sample.
